# pico-bus
A small Raspi Pico app that shows bus times for your local stops

## Pre-Requisites

- [A Raspberry Pi Pico W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/) (With soldered headers)
- [A Pico Inky Pack](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-inky-pack?variant=40044626051155)

## Getting Started

First connect the Raspberry Pi Pico W to the Pico Inky Pack

Next use [this guide](https://learn.pimoroni.com/article/getting-started-with-pico) for **Installing the custom firmware** and **Installing Thonny**

Next, use Thonny to save `busgraphics.py` into the Pico W (assuming the Pico W connected succesfully in the previous section).

Finally load `main.py` into Thonny click the **Run current script** button (Green play button)

The pico-bus software should now load successfully.
